A little lightness is welcome, and the 45-minute episodes of “Loki” (premiering Wednesday) fly by painlessly, though they may not deliver quite as much jokey satisfaction per minute as you’d like. If the writing has dull patches, there’s always the company of a stellar cast, headlined by Tom Hiddleston as Loki and filled out by Owen Wilson as Loki’s detective partner from the Time Variance Authority, Wunmi Mosaku as a SWAT cop of the pure time stream and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as a judge in time court.
The focus on time is the vehicle by which Marvel once again brings back Loki, who was killed two “Avengers” films ago. In the most recent film, “Avengers: Endgame,” a time-travel plotline enabled him to make a cameo reappearance; that wrinkle in the continuum is now, in the series, the explanation for his apprehension by the T.V.A., which monitors past, present and future for divergences from the proper course of events. (That implies predestination, raising a lot of troubling questions for the larger Marvel universe, which are addressed briefly and unsatisfactorily.)
